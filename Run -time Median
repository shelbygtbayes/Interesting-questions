Question : How to determine the median of Array of Integers at run-time ?
                            i.e
            Integers are adding up to the array dynamically and we have to determine the median at each point
            
Example : 6 , 4 , 0 , 2           --> 2+4/2 = 3
          6 , 4 , 0 , 2 , 12      --> 4
          6 , 4 , 0 , 2 , 12 , 5  --> 4+5/2 = 3.5
          and so on..
